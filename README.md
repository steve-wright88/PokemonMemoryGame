# PokemonMemoryGame

The game starts when you click the first card. The timer begins to run down until you have matched all the cards on the board. There's no limit to the amount of attempts to can make to match all the cards, however, there is a counter in the top right corner that counts every time you click two cards.

The theme of the game is Pokemon first Gen and I have selected 12 Pokemon that you have to try and match during the game.
